The parser is based on the [GeoCat/bridge-style](https://github.com/GeoCat/bridge-style)\\nand was ported from Python into TypeScript. It is now integrated into the GeoStyler ecosystem, so that it integrates seamlessly with all the other existing parsers! That means that it is now possible to convert\\nArcGIS styles to QGIS, Mapbox, OpenLayers, and SLD! So far reading ArcGIS Pro styles with\\nfeatures layers, meaning point, line, polygon or text classes, with margin, padding, offset, colors and more is possible! Expressions are already implemented but need some corrections. Handling icons is a work in progress.\\n\\nKudos to \\n[@ger-benjamin](https://github.com/ger-benjamin),\\n[@jwkaltz](https://github.com/jwkaltz),\\n[@myriamfischer](https://github.com/myriamfischer),\\n[@thomasmarti](https://github.com/thomasmarti),\\n[@eschuh](https://github.com/eschuh),\\n[@bsteinemann](https://github.com/bsteinemann).\\n\\nBesides that, an ArcGIS integration was created that allows for visually comparing ArcGIS styles with their SLD equivalents,\\nmaking use of the [GeoStyler REST API](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-rest).\\n\\nKudos to \\n[@myriamfischer](https://github.com/myriamfischer),\\n[@thomasmarti](https://github.com/thomasmarti),\\n[@eschuh](https://github.com/eschuh),\\n[@bsteinemann](https://github.com/bsteinemann).\\n\\n### GeoStyler QGIS Plugin\\n\\nMaking use of the [geostyler-cli](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-cli),\\na new QGIS Plugin called [geostyler-qgis-plugin](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-qgis-plugin)\\nwas created that allows exporting layer styles from QGIS into the other formats supported by GeoStyler. In the future, we also intend\\nto extend the plugin with importing capabilities, so that users are able to import other styling formats into QGIS.\\n\\n![GeoStyler QGIS Plugin](./geostyler-codesprint-2024-qgis-plugin.png)\\n\\nKudos to\\n[@geographika](https://github.com/geographika),\\n[@jansule](https://github.com/jansule).\\n\\n### GeoStyler CLI\\n\\nDependencies in the [geostyler-cli](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-cli) were upgraded to their latest versions. Furthermore,\\nthe executing commands for the different environments such as node, npx, binary executable, were harmonized. For all environments,\\nthe executing command will now be `geostyler-cli`!\\n\\nKudos to\\n[@geographika](https://github.com/geographika),\\n[@jansule](https://github.com/jansule).\\n\\n### GeoStyler-Style\\n\\nThe [geostyler-style](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-style) was extended with additional function expressions.\\nThe basic casting expressions `toNumber` and `toString` were added, which allow for converting values to numbers and\\nstrings, respectively. Additionally, `step` and `interpolate` expressions will now be supported, making it possible\\nto provide categorized and interpolated values.\\n\\nKudos to\\n[@kaivolland](https://github.com/kaivolland),\\n[@jansule](https://github.com/jansule).\\n\\n### GeoStyler Mapbox Parser\\n\\nThe [geostyler-mapbox-parser](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-mapbox-parser) now successfully reads colors as hex-codes\\nas well as RGBA strings into the GeoStyler style. This works for both hardcoded color values and color values in (nested) expressions.\\nAlso the parser now supports the newly introduced `interpolate` expression.\\n\\nKudos to\\n[@jansule](https://github.com/jansule).\\n\\n### GeoStyler SLD Parser\\n\\nThe usability of the [geostyler-sld-parser](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-sld-parser) was improved by automatically reading\\nthe version of a given SLD from the style itself. Through this, it is now possible to up-/downgrade SLDs while using only a\\nsingle instance of the parser. Additionally, the geostyler-sld-parser now supports translating its error messages into multiple languages,\\nwhich allows for easier communicating styling errors with the style editors.\\n\\nKudos to\\n[@ocruze](https://github.com/ocruze),\\n[@pprev94](https://github.com/pprev94).\\n\\n### GeoStyler UI\\n\\nThe [GeoStyler UI](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler) was improved by adding an upload file button to the code editor.\\nAdditionally, the expressions UI was extended with elements for the `case` and `step` function expressions.\\n\\n![GeoStyler UI Step Expression](./geostyler-codesprint-2024-expression-step.png)\\n\\nKudos to\\n[@kaivolland](https://github.com/kaivolland),\\n[@pprev94](https://github.com/pprev94).\\n\\n### GeoStyler Visual Comparator\\n\\nA not-yet published tool for visually comparing different styles that were processed by GeoStyler was improved by adding\\nadditional styles to compare and tweaking the UI.\\n\\n![GeoStyler Visual Comparator](./geostyler-codesprint-2024-comparator.png)\\n\\nKudos to \\n[@jansule](https://github.com/jansule).\\n\\n### GeoStyler Homepage Design\\n\\nA new design concept for the GeoStyler Homepage was created that serves all static content at one place. As part of that,\\nthe homepage, tutorials, showcases, demo applications and more should all be directly accessible from\\nthe homepage. The new design is intended to better deliver the message of GeoStyler while still being easy to maintain.\\n\\n![GeoStyler Homepage Design](./geostyler-codesprint-2024-design.png)\\n\\nKudos to\\n[@linegallen](https://github.com/linegallen),\\n[@sarastreit](https://github.com/saraStreit),\\n[@antonellostruzzolino](https://github.com/antonellostruzzolino),\\n[@slafayIGN](https://github.com/slafayIGN),\\n[@jansule](https://github.com/jansule).\\n\\n### ESModule Builds\\n\\nThe GeoStyler packages were harmonized and now all provide ESModule builds in their distributions. We also moved from\\nwebpack to vite and vitest in order to simplify our tooling.\\n\\nKudos to\\n[@kaivolland](https://github.com/kaivolland),\\n[@hwbllmnn](https://github.com/hwbllmnn).\\n\\n### GeoStyler REST\\n\\nThe [GeoStyler REST API](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-rest) received some updates and now makes use\\nof bun.\\n\\n![GeoStyler Rest Image](./geostyler-codesprint-2024-rest.png)\\n\\nKudos to\\n[@kaivolland](https://github.com/kaivolland).\\n\\n### GeoStyler and the French State Design System\\n\\nIGN started working on integrating the GeoStyler UI components into applications using the\\n[French State Design System](https://www.systeme-de-design.gouv.fr/),\\nshowcasing the customization possibilities of these components.\\n\\n![GeoStyler in French State Design System](./geostyler-codesprint-2024-ign-design.png)\\n\\nKudos to\\n[@ocruze](https://github.com/ocruze).\\n\\n### Additional achievements\\n\\nBesides the above mentioned achievements, we also managed to upgrade dependencies, updated pipelines to\\ninclude semantic-release and webhooks that notify our discord users about published releases,\\nfor many of our repositories. It is now also possible to publish beta releases in order to try out\\nexperimental features.\\n\\nKudos to\\n[@hwbllmnn](https://github.com/hwbllmnn),\\n[@kaivolland](https://github.com/kaivolland),\\n[@bsteinemann](https://github.com/bsteinemann),\\n[@geographika](https://github.com/geographika),\\n[@jansule](https://github.com/jansule).\\n\\n### Stats\\n\\n![GeoStyler Code Sprint Stats](./geostyler-codesprint-2024-stats.png)\\n\\nWe especially want to welcome our new contributors to the GeoStyler project! We are happy for a\\ngrowing community and are looking forward to the future development of the GeoStyler project.\\n\\nAgain, we want to thank everyone who participated in this Code Sprint.

KG](https://www.terrestris.de) for providing the facilities and handing out these great GeoStyler cups!\\n\\nAdditional thanks to all companies that supported this event by allowing their employees to participate!\\n\\nAll of this helped us strengthening the bonds between all participants and thereby, you play an important\\nrole in growing the GeoStyler community.\\n\\n## Contributions\\n\\nDuring the Code Sprint, we achieved the following:\\n\\n![GeoStyler Code Sprint Stats](./geostyler-codesprint-2023-stats.png)\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n### GeoStyler CLI\\n\\nThe [GeoStyler CLI](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-cli) can now additionally be used as standalone executable! There is no need to install Node.js anymore, if you just want to convert between different styling formats without using the UI. The executables can be downloaded for each version from the [repository](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-cli/releases). We support Linux, MacOS and Windows.\\n\\nBesides that, some maintenance work was done on the repository and semantic-release was enabled.\\n\\nKudos to [@geographika](https://github.com/geographika) and [@jansule](https://github.com/jansule).\\n\\n### GeoStyler Converter\\n\\nWe now have a new demo application that solely focusses on the conversion between different styling formats: [GeoStyler Converter Demo](https://geostyler.github.io/geostyler-converter-demo/). Paste a style into one of the editors, edit the style and convert it into any other format. Some final polishing is still in the making, but the GeoStyler Converter Demo can already be used. See also the [geostyler-converter-demo repository](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-converter-demo/).\\n\\n![GeoStyler Converter Demo](./geostyler-codesprint-2023-converter.png)\\n\\nKudos to [@slafayIGN](https://github.com/slafayIGN), [@ocruze](https://github.com/ocruze) and [@pprev94](https://github.com/pprev94).\\n\\n### Support for Expressions in the UI\\n\\nAfter setting the basement for the usage of expressions in the last code sprint in 2022, the GeoStyler UI now also supports expressions. Users are now enabled to create styling rules based on attributes of their dataset. Colors, sizes, strokes, etc. can now all be computed with values derived from the geodata itself. So if you want the size of a point representing a city being proportional to the number of its inhabitants, this can now be easily achieved. Many real-world styling challenges can now be adressed in an appropriate, compact and flexible way. And the best part of it: There is no need to write the expressions by hand. The UI provides a graphical editor just for that. Now, the parsers need to be updated to fully support this feature.\\n\\n![Expressions UI example](./geostyler-codesprint-2023-expressions.gif)\\n\\nKudos to [@kaivolland](https://github.com/kaivolland).\\n\\n### GeoStyler UI\\n\\nBesides the support for expressions, the GeoStyler UI was improved in various ways. We are currently adding icons to options in dropdowns, so users can directly see what an option stands for. What was the difference again between `butt`, `round`, and `square` line caps? The answer will be directly graspable from the editor.\\n\\nWe also cleaned up some dependencies, make use of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for creating our browser builds, improved the test performance, and upgraded to antd 5. As part of this, we replaced the windows with antd modals and did some polishing here and there.\\n\\nThe previously introduced `GeoStylerContext` was also implemented in various components, which will simplify adjusting the GeoStyler UI to your needs.\\n\\n![GeoStyler UI Modal Example](./geostyler-codesprint-2023-modals.gif)\\n\\nKudos to [@dnlkoch](https://github.com/dnlkoch), [@SchulA](https://github.com/SchulA), [@jansule](https://github.com/jansule) and [@hwbllmnn](https://github.com/hwbllmnn).\\n\\n### GeoStyler Mapbox Parser\\n\\nWe spent quite some time discussing the [geostyler-mapbox-parser](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-mapbox-parser) and how we can integrate the concept of map-based styles (which mapbox is using) in addition to layer-based styles (which SLD is using) in GeoStyler. We came to the conclusion that layers in mapbox fit quite well to the idea of rules in layer-based styles. Both are entities consisting of filters, scale denominators and styling instructions. With the support for expressions in GeoStyler in particular, we should now be able to advance the development of the geostyler-mapbox-parser and make it a first class citizen in the GeoStyler ecosystem.\\n\\nBesides that, the geostyler-mapbox-parser was enhanced by splitting or merging styling rules where needed. A consistent style structure after parsing is still being maintained by enriching the mapbox-style with metadata.\\n\\nKudos to [@ocruze](https://github.com/ocruze), [@pprev94](https://github.com/pprev94), [@slafayIGN](https://github.com/slafayIGN), [@kaivolland](https://github.com/kaivolland), [@jansule](https://github.com/jansule) and [@ahocevar](https://github.com/ahocevar).\\n\\n### GeoStyler Homepage\\n\\nThe [GeoStyler homepage](https://geostyler.org/) was updated to provide better information about the idea of GeoStyler and the different tools that it provides. GeoStyler is more than just a UI library!\\n\\n![GeoStyler Homepage Example](./geostyler-codesprint-2023-homepage.png)\\n\\n<br />\\n\\nKudos to [@OSHistory](https://github.com/OSHistory), [@geographika](https://github.com/geographika) and [@jansule](https://github.com/jansule).\\n\\n### GeoStyler SymCore Parser\\n\\nWe added a new parser to the GeoStyler ecosystem: the [geostyler-symcore-parser](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-symcore-parser). This parser will allow the conversion between geostyler-style and the new [OGC Styles & Symbology Models and Encodings - Part 1: Core](https://github.com/opengeospatial/styles-and-symbology) standard. For now, the parser only contains the typings of the standard, but will be implemented in the future. This parser should facilitate the switch to the new standard and will hopefully increase the adoption of it.\\n\\nKudos to [@kaivolland](https://github.com/kaivolland) and [@jansule](https://github.com/jansule).\\n\\n### GeoStyler GeoServer Plugin\\n\\nThe [geostyler-geoserver-plugin](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-geoserver-plugin) was updated to use the latest version of GeoStyler. Additionally, multiple bugs were fixed and the build artifacts are now being published on [nexus.terrestris.de](https://nexus.terrestris.de/#browse/browse:geoserver-extras:org%2Fgeoserver%2Fcommunity%2Fgs-geostyler). Instructions on how to download and use the build artifacts were added to the README.\\n\\n![GeoStyler GeoServer Plugin](./geostyler-codesprint-2023-geoserver.png)\\n\\nKudos to [@dnlkoch](https://github.com/dnlkoch), [@hwbllmnn](https://github.com/hwbllmnn) and [@marcjansen](https://github.com/marcjansen).\\n\\n### Miscellaneous\\n\\nUsers will now be redirected to the [GeoStyler homepage](https://geostyler.org/) when going to [geostyler.github.io](https://geostyler.github.io/).\\n\\nThe [geostyler-cql-parser](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-cql-parser/) was fixed, so that it can be directly used without the need to add configurations to webpack.\\n\\nThe GeoStyler repositories are now transitioning to using issue forms instead of templates. This should lower the barrier for non-technical users to create issues and thereby helping GeoStyler becoming a more welcoming community. See for example the issue form for a [feature request](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler/issues/new?assignees=jansule%2CKaiVolland&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.yaml).\\n\\nThe [GeoStyler Beginner Workshop](https://geostyler.github.io/geostyler-beginner-workshop/) is currently being updated and will use Docusaurus instead of Jekyll as static site generator. The content of the workshop will also be updated in the future, to reflect the latest state of GeoStyler.\\n\\nThe robustness of [geostyler-rest](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-rest) was improved by better handling unknown input and output formats, or inconsistent styles.\\n\\nKudos to [@slafayIGN](https://github.com/slafayIGN), [@OSHistory](https://github.com/OSHistory) and [@jansule](https://github.com/jansule).\\n\\n### Conference talks and other media\\n\\nGeoStyler will be featured on multiple talks on FOSS4G 2023.\\n\\nKudos to everyone!\\n\\nAgain, we want to thank everyone who participated in this Code Sprint. It was great fun and an absolute pleasure working with you! We are already looking forward to the next GeoStyler Code Sprint."},{"id":"/2022/codesprint","metadata":{"permalink":"/geostyler-docusaurus/blog/2022/codesprint","source":"@site/blog/2022/codesprint.md","title":"GeoStyler Code Sprint 2022","description":"From Tuesday, 07.06 until Friday, 10.06.2022 the first GeoStyler Code Sprint took place. 12 motivated coders from all over the world participated and provided great contributions to the GeoStyler project.","date":"2022-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":4.81,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"date":"2022-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","title":"GeoStyler Code Sprint 2022"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"GeoStyler Code Sprint 2023","permalink":"/geostyler-docusaurus/blog/2023/codesprint"}},"content":"From Tuesday, 07.06 until Friday, 10.06.2022 the first GeoStyler Code Sprint took place. 12 motivated coders from all over the world participated and provided great contributions to the GeoStyler project.\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\nWe want to thank everyone who contributed to the GeoStyler project.

Check out https://geostyler.github.io/geostyler-cookbook/ for the current state.\\n\\nKudos to [@krishnaglodha](https://github.com/krishnaglodha) and [@jansule](https://github.com/jansule).\\n\\n### GeoStyler CardLayout\\n\\nIn October 2021, a concept for an additional layout for the [GeoStyler UI](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler) was created and main features were implemented. This layout omits the use of windows and thereby provides a clean and mobile-friendly look. During the Code Sprint, the implementation could be finalized, and the new layout can be used via the `<CardStyle />` component.\\n\\n![GeoStyler Card Layout Example](./geostyler-card-layout-hp.gif)\\n\\nKudos to [@annarieger](https://github.com/annarieger) and [@jansule](https://github.com/jansule).\\n\\n### GeoStyler GeoServer Plugin\\n\\nMultiple fixes and improvements were applied to the [GeoStyler community extension for GeoServer](https://docs.geoserver.org/main/en/user/community/geostyler/index.html). Tests were added, deploy pipelines created, the overall integration into GeoServer was improved and a docker based Dev-Setup was created. Also, the extension will now be served under the dedicated repository [geostyler-geoserver-plugin](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-geoserver-plugin).\\n\\n![GeoStyler GeoServer Plugin](./geostyler-geoserver-plugin.png)\\n\\nKudos to [@dnlkoch](https://github.com/dnlkoch).\\n\\n### Dev-Experience / Dev-Setup\\n\\nDev-Experience and Dev-Setup were improved in many different ways. We now have a better support for developing on windows.\\nAlso, the performance for building and working with our interactive documentation was improved drastically.\\n\\nKudos to [@slafayIGN](https://github.com/slafayIGN), [@geographika](https://github.com/geographika), [@ocruze](https://github.com/ocruze), [@pprev94](https://github.com/pprev94), [@dnlkoch](https://github.com/dnlkoch) and [@kaivolland](https://github.com/kaivolland).\\n\\n### Support for Expressions\\n\\nFor quite a while, we were working on the support of expressions in GeoStyler. Through these, it is possible to set styling properties attributively and feature-based, which allows for more compact and dynamic styles. For example, color values can be calculated based on a function that uses attributes of the dataset as function arguments. So instead of providing a single rule for each possible color value respectively, users can now provide a single rule that describes the color value for all features based on a single expression.\\n\\nExpressions are now supported in the [geostyler-style](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-style/) format and was already implemented for the [geostyler-cql-parser](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-cql-parser/) and the [geostyler-sld-parser](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-sld-parser/). We will work on supporting other parsers in the future.\\n\\nKudos to [@hwbllmnn](https://github.com/hwbllmnn).\\n\\n### French translations\\n\\nGeoStyler now also supports French.\\n\\nKudos to [@slafayIGN](https://github.com/slafayIGN).\\n\\n### GeoStyler REST API\\n\\nThe [GeoStyler REST API](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-rest) was enhanced by providing a new API endpoint `GET /geostyler-rest/api/versions` that gives information about the versions of the used parsers. Besides that, multiple bugfixes and minor improvements were done.\\n\\nKudos to [@chrismayer](https://github.com/chrismayer).\\n\\n### Unsupported properties\\n\\nThe [GeoStyler UI](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler) as well as the [geostyler-openlayers-parser](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-openlayers-parser) and [geostyler-sld-parser](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-sld-parser) make now use of the `unsupportedProperties` interface. Due to these changes, the UI now gives hints about properties that were used in the UI but are not supported by a specific parser.\\n\\nKudos to [@kaivolland](https://github.com/kaivolland).\\n\\n### Mapfile validation\\n\\nThe [geostyler-mapfile-parser](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-mapfile-parser) will soon be able to validate mapfiles.\\n\\nKudos to [@geographika](https://github.com/geographika).\\n\\n### GeoStyler Demo\\n\\nThe [demo application](https://geostyler.github.io/geostyler-demo/) was improved in multiple ways. The `<PreviewMap />` component now enables zooming and panning in order to verify proper scaleDenominator configuration. The demo now also provides feedback when loading style and/or data. Furthermore, we got rid of using create-react-app and provided our own webpack configuration which facilitates working with linked dependencies.\\n\\nKudos to [@ocruze](https://github.com/ocruze), [@pprev94](https://github.com/pprev94), [@hwbllmnn](https://github.com/hwbllmnn) and [@jansule](https://github.com/jansule).\\n\\n### GeoStyler Mapbox Parser\\n\\nThe [geostyler-mapbox-parser](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-mapbox-parser) was improved by fixing the opacity handling for MarkSymbolizer and harmonizing its behaviour with the other parsers.\\n\\nKudos to [@ocruze](https://github.com/ocruze) and [@pprev94](https://github.com/pprev94).\\n\\n### Refactorings\\n\\nAll class based React components were refactored into the more compact and better maintainable function based components.\\n\\nKudos to [@kaivolland](https://github.com/kaivolland).\\n\\n### Bugfixes\\n\\nThe [geostyler-cli](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-cli) now also works properly on windows.\\n\\nKudos to [@geographika](https://github.com/geographika).\\n\\n### Conference talks and other media\\n\\nGeoStyler will be featured on multiple talks on FOSS4G 2022. Also, there will be videos published on how to work with GeoStyler.\\n\\nKudos to everyone!\\n\\nAgain, we want to thank everyone who participated in this Code Sprint. It was great fun and an absolute pleasure working with you!"}]}}')}}]);
