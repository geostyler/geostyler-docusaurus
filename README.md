# GeoStyler Docusaurus Website

This repo contains an attempt to rebuild the GeoStyler website using docusaurus.

**Why Docusaurus?**

It enables the use of both static markdown content and dynamic react components. GeoStyler is a React Library!


## Website content

The goal would be to include :

- static pages (homepage, legal notice)
- blog posts (code sprint articles, announcements)
- tutorials and workshops (formerly built with Gitbook)
- technical documentations

## Languages

- english

Other languages can be added, cf. https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/introduction.

## Local Development

```
$ npm i
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
