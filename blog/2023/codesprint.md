We also want to thank the sponsors of this year's code sprint:

<!-- FOSSGIS logo is imported differently to enable specifying the height -->
<!-- OSGeo logo in SVG cannot be imported like FOSSGIS logo, it uses the "normal" markdown image inclusion -->

import logoFossgis from '/img/logo-fossgis.png'

<img src={logoFossgis} alt="logo FOSSGIS" height="84px"/>


Thank you, [OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/), for sponsoring the social event!

Thank you, [FOSSGIS e.V.](https://www.fossgis.de/), for sponsoring the catering for the whole week!

We also want to thank [terrestris GmbH & Co. KG](https://www.terrestris.de) for providing the facilities and handing out these great GeoStyler cups!

Additional thanks to all companies that supported this event by allowing their employees to participate!

role in growing the GeoStyler community.
